== Path Finding
A graphic program to visualize a path finding algorithm.

=== Building
You can use the Makefile. +
``$ make && make install``

=== Use
This is a simple program. You have two points.
You can move them (left mouse click) and place obstacles (right mouse click).
A line will allways draw the shortest path between those
two points, as long as there is one.

=== Arguments
* ``-d <n_rows>x<n_cols>`` : Set dimensions for the grid
* ``-w <width>`` : Set width of grid's cells
* ``--heuristic <name>``: Set the heuristic to use
* ``--size [small|medium|large]``: Set the size of the grid

=== Keybindings
* ``A``: Display a search animation while traversing the grid
* ``V``: Color the blocks which have been visited during the search
* ``R``: Generate a grid with random obstacles
* ``M``: Fill all the grid with obstacles, so you can draw a maze
* ``C``: Clear the grid
* ``T``: Switch between dark and light theme
* ``H``: Toggle horizontal movement on and off
* ``F5``: Redraw path
