Path Finding
Author: Sa√∫l Valdelvira
======================================
A graphic program to visualize a
path finding algorithm.

Dependencies:
Requires SDL2 library.
Link: <https://www.libsdl.org/>

Use:
This is a simple program. You have two points. You can move
them (right mouse click) and place obstacles (left mouse click).
A yellow line will allways draw the shortest path between those
two points, as long as there is one.

Keys:
- V: Also color the blocks wich have been visited during the search.
- M: Fill all the grid with obstacles, so you can draw a maze.
- C: Clear the grid.
- T: Switch between dark and light theme

How:
This program uses the A* algorithm to find a path. The heuristic for
the algorithm is the euclidean distance between two points.
